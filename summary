ver the last decade, beijing has sponsored at least 70 confucius institutes (ci) in the united states -- chinese state-run instutions which partner with american institutions to provide chinese language and culture study to u.s. students. with the exception of one positive message, the lack of any other response suggests that expediency and cowardice rather than conscience and justice are the hallmarks of the cis -- not surprising in view of their provenance and the role they play in china's cultural diplomacy. yet would we have blithely accepted pushkin institutes on our campuses funded by the murderous stalinist autocracy? matteo mecacci, president of the international campaign for tibet:

first, any increase in the teaching of mandarin chinese in schools is a positive. one, maybe two overburdened tenure-track faculty members and instructors keep the program afloat, but not much more. it is up to the regular tenured and tenure-track faculty to facilitate that process and make sure our students get the best experience that we can offer them. stephen e. hanson, vice provost for international affairs, director of the wendy and emery reves center for international studies, and lettie pate evans professor in the department of government at the college of william & mary:

the statement by the american association of university professors (aaup) calling on all universities hosting confucius institutes to consider closing them immediately appears to be based on a misunderstanding of several important elements of how such programs run in practice. if aaup is instead arguing that j-1 programs should be stopped only with china, but not with russia, the united arab emirates, uganda, singapore, or any number of other countries where academic governance and labor laws fall short of ideal u.s standards, then that argument needs to be somehow justified and substantiated in much more detail.

last week, the american association of university professors called on almost a hundred u.s. universities to reexamine their ties with beijing��s signature cultural outpost. ��confucius institutes function as an arm of the chinese state and are allowed to ignore academic freedom.��

chinese officials have said that these institutes are key to expanding the country��s soft power, and constitute ��an important part of china��s overseas propaganda setup.�� they��ve proliferated quickly, with china aiming to hit ��500 large cities across the world by 2020.��

better soft power than the alternative. at north carolina state university in 2009, the confucius institute allegedly objected to the university��s invitation to the dalai lama, a tibetan spiritual leader whom china considers a traitor. china is a major trading partner for north carolina.��

three years later, institute instructor sonia zhao told a human rights tribunal that her employment contract dictated she was ��not allowed to join illegal organizations such as falun gong,�� a spiritual movement that china sees as a threat. self-censorship �� illustrated by the nation with a university of chicago administrator��s acknowledgment that he would not hang a picture of the dalai lama in its confucius institute �� has also been documented. these concerns have led some universities to reject china��s proposals.

fear or ignorance drives confucius institutes�� critics, xinhua says
by bree feng  june 24, 2014 7:24 am

chinese state media on tuesday defended the spread of confucius institutes worldwide, lashing back at a recent call for north american universities to rethink their links with the cultural and language programs, which are backed by the chinese government. the criticism of one of china��s most visible soft-power initiatives struck a sour note with xinhua, the state news agency, which dismissed the group��s concerns as stemming from ��either fear of other cultures or ignorance �� or both.��

in its english-language editorial, xinhua said the professors�� criticisms expose ��their own intolerance of exotic cultures and biased preconceived notions to smear and isolate�� the chinese communist party. (xinhua��s editorial refers to him as the ��great chinese sage.��)

last november, president xi jinping visited the sage��s hometown and noted the success of confucius institutes abroad, even among ��some countries that have ideological prejudices against�� china.

aaup urges universities to cut ties with confucius institutes for ignoring academic freedom

jun 25, 2014 02:34 am edt by stephen adkins, universityherald reporter

the american association of university professors (aaup) is urging colleges and universities nationwide to cut their ties with confucius institutes for disregarding academic freedom. a recently released report by the association said that integrity of the universities and academic staff had been sacrificed by permitting the chinese government to oversee curriculum and staff at the institutes. "allowing any third-party control of academic matters is inconsistent with principles of academic freedom, shared governance, and the institutional autonomy of colleges and universities," the report by the association's committee on academic freedom and tenure stated. stephen dunnett, chairman of the bi-national committee that supervises the university at buffalo's five-year-old institute, said that the chinese do sponsor these activities but they don't control them. "it is true that it is a program under the chinese ministry of education, but the accusations reflect the cold war mentality," xu said, nbc news reports.

us professors troubled by confucius institutes

buffalo, new york (ap) �� university professors in the united states have joined their canadian counterparts in urging universities to cut ties with confucius institutes unless the agreements that bring them to campus are re-worked to guarantee academic freedom. the canadian association of university teachers raised the same issues in december following an instructor's human rights complaint alleging discrimination based on her belief in falun gong, a spiritual group that has been banned in china. the beijing headquarters for the confucius institutes, the office of chinese language council international, known as hanban, did not respond to requests from the associated press for comment. however, the communist party's flagship newspaper, people's daily, ran an article friday seeking to refute the aaup report's claims, quoting representatives from foreign institutions from germany to thailand who called them unfounded. the aaup recommended universities cut ties unless agreements with hanban are rewritten to give the universities unilateral control over teachers, curriculum and texts, and confucius institute teachers the same academic freedoms as other university faculty.

the american association of university professors (aaup) called for agreements between confucius institutes and nearly 100 universities to be either cancelled or renegotiated so that they properly reflected western values of free speech. "most agreements establishing confucius institutes feature nondisclosure clauses and unacceptable concessions to the political aims and practices of the government of china," the aaup statement added. however the aaup drew a clear distinction between the british and french organisations, which existed off-campus and openly fulfilled their mandates, with the on-campus confucius institutes that are allowed to bypass basic tenets of academic freedom in exchange for money. the universities of edinburgh, manchester, cardiff, central wales, nottingham, sheffield, soas, the london school of economics, london south bank university, liverpool and central lancashire are all listed as having confucius institutes. in the past, china has batted away criticism of its institutes, with the chinese ambassador to london accusing critics of submitting to "cold war thinking" in 2012 after christopher hughes, a china expert at the london school of economics, raised concerns about hosting such centres in the wake of a scandal over the lse's taking funding from the regime of libyan dictator muammar gaddafi.
