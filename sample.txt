In 2012, the second Confucius Institute in Alabama was established at Auburn Montgomery. (Troy University hosts Alabama's other Confucius Institute.) Ceremonies in Montgomery, which included Chinese and Alabama officials, followed ceremonies in Beijing and Wuhan.

The institute is affiliated with the Office of Chinese Language Council International, a non-government and nonprofit organization affiliated with the Chinese government. It is one of more than 300 Confucius institutes worldwide whose purpose is to promote "the teaching of the Chinese (Mandarin) language and promote educational and cultural exchanges." The institute reflects AUM's Far Eastern Initiatives and the relationship of the AUM community with 34 Chinese universities.

In the last two years, the Confucius Institute has hosted or sponsored numerous activities, ranging from cultural events to free Chinese language classes to intensive business Chinese classes for which tuition is required. There are even trips to China for local public school teachers and students.

On the institute's first anniversary, ground was broken for a Confucius Garden on one of the highest elevations on the AUM campus. The centerpiece of that garden is a Chinese-made, larger-than-life bronze bust of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551-479 BC).

As have so many philosophers and religious leaders, Confucius taught that individuals ultimately are responsible for their own behavior, which must be based on compassion or love for others. Confucius taught that self-discipline and the subordination of self are required to serve the needs of family and the larger community. Without serving family, neighborhood, school, community, work, government, and nation — before self — there is strife and disorder.

Since service before self is contrary to human nature, Confucius thought that it could only be fully understood and internalized by long, serious study and reflection. This leads to a moral life of integrity and to a harmonious society.

Confucianism has influenced East Asian culture for more than 2,000 years, and today it influences those of East Asian ancestry all over the world. It seems even more remarkable as Christianity and its message of love and selflessness declines in the West, where it is increasingly supplanted by materialism with its values of self-absorption and self-gratification.
